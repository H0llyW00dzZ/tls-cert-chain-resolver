# TLS Cert Chain Resolver

TLS Cert Chain Resolver is a CLI tool designed to resolve and manage TLS certificate chains efficiently. This tool is inspired by [zakjan/cert-chain-resolver](https://github.com/zakjan/cert-chain-resolver.git), but offers a more maintainable codebase and is actively maintained.

## Features

- Resolve TLS certificate chains
- Output in PEM or DER format
- Optionally include system root CAs
- Efficient memory usage with buffer pooling

## Installation

```bash
go install github.com/H0llyW00dzZ/tls-cert-chain-resolver@latest
```

## Usage

```bash

```

### Options

- `-o, --output`: Output to a specified file (default: stdout)
- `-i, --intermediate-only`: Output intermediate certificates only
- `-d, --der`: Output in DER format
